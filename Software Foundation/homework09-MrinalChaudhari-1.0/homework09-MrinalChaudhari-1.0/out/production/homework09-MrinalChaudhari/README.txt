a. How is this lab an example of reuse through inheritance?

The concept of Inheritance is nothing but to reuse the code again and again in order to reduce the size of program.
In this Project, Pokemon is the parent class with many attribute like name, type,attack,and health.
And FIRE,WATER, and GRASS are the subclasses or child classes which is derived from parent class i.e Pokemon.
Hence, attributes of pokemon class can be used in child classes (FIRE,WATER,GRASS) without declaring same variable in the child class.

Using Pokemon class as a parent class in child classes reduces the size of program and it can be used in many classes using "Extend" keyword.
